*Alice and Bob are fictional characters commonly used as placeholders in discussions about cryptographic systems and protocols and in other scientific and engineering literature where there are several participants in a thought experiment. Alice is the source of the transmitted message, and Bob is the receiving party. Eva is also present in the experiment, which acts as a signal interceptor.*

In the first point of the work, the key was encoded and successfully transmitted
using quantum cryptography methods. In the second one, Alice's signal was successfully intercepted with Eve's help and transmitted to Bob. This intervention
did not go unnoticed.
