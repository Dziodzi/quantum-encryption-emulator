*Alice and Bob are fictional characters commonly used as placeholders in discussions about cryptographic systems and protocols and in other scientific and engineering literature where there are several participants in a thought experiment. Alice is the source of the transmitted message, and Bob is the receiving party. Eva is also present in the experiment, which acts as a signal interceptor.*

## Example of how the program works

+ Task 1: A key was received [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which, when translated into alphabetic format, has the form DQBA.
+ Task 2: The encrypted word JETT was translated into LQRQ using the key according to the rules of binary addition, and after receiving it from Alice to Bob, LQRQ was decrypted as JETT, which means there was no mistake anywhere.
+ Task 3: Thanks to the basis table, unsuitable bits were detected in the basis match table, which accounted for 0.5 of the total number of measurements with matching bases, which indicates the presence of an interceptor in the system.
